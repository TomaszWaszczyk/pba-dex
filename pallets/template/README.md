## DEX

I have imported `pallet-assets` and was trying to implement tracing balances, but without working version. But I got to know more about dispachable functions.

After the crazy time (PBA) I will work on the dex futher. Here is [my try](https://github.com/TomaszWaszczyk/pba-dex/blob/main/pallets/template/src/lib.rs) with assets pallet - this is NOT awesome.

Thanks for organizing PBA.


God Bless You,
